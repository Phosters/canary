# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors:
    - Canary version appeared as v3 instead of expected v2.
    - Traffic split was heavily skewed toward the canary deployment.
  suggested_improvements:
    - Ensure version labels are consistent and updated in the deployment manifests.
    - Adjust traffic routing rules for a more balanced canary rollout if desired.
    - Add automated checks to verify version and traffic distribution after deployment.
